# 🏗️ Crack Detection 

This project demonstrates **automated crack detection** in concrete structures using **Landing AI's computer vision platform**.  
It leverages AI-powered image classification/object detection to identify cracks, helping improve **structural safety monitoring**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects cracks in concrete/metal surfaces using AI.
- Built using **LandingLens (Landing AI)**.
- Easy to integrate with camera feeds or image datasets.
- Trained on custom dataset of crack vs. non-crack images.
- Exportable model for deployment (e.g., Python SDK, Edge devices).
